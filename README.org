   : (require 'evil-find-char-pinyin)

** Usage
   To enable the mode:
   : (evil-find-char-pinyin-mode +1)

   After you enable the mode, =evil='s f/F/t/T commands are able to jump to
   Chinese characters by their Pinyin.

   For example (=|= is the location of the cursor):
   : |我能吞下玻璃而不伤身体。

   =dft= will delete =我能吞= 。

   It also supports Chinese punctuactions:
   : |我能吞下玻璃而不伤身体。

   =dt.= will delete up to =。=.
